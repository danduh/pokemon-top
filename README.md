# TALK

Demonstrate MFEs with UI testing per each MFE

- Ability to run UI tests per MFE for faster CI and development
- Ability to run all tests for entrie app all together.
- Change MFE's framework (Recat <-> NG) without changing UI tests
- Show test kits and explain the reusability of UI Testing Foundation beeing framework seemless.

# How to develop ✨

## Run host and all MFEs alltogether

First run MFEs, each command per terminal

```bash
nx serve-static list
nx serve-static details
```

Or you can run all MFEs with one command

```bash
nx run-many -t serve-static -p list,details
```

Run host app:

```bash
nx serve pokemon --skipRemotes list,details --watch
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:4200>

## Develop each MFE indepandatley

### list MFE

```bash
npx nx serve list
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:4201>

### details MFE

```bash
npx nx serve details
```

Navigate to <http://localhost:4202>

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
